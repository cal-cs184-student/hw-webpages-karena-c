			<h2>Overview</h2>
			In this homework, we created implementation for de Casteljau’s algorithm to evaluate both Bezier curves as well as Bezier surfaces. We also created support for triangle meshes using the Half-Edge data structure by writing functions to implement flipping, splitting, and upsampling features. 
			<br><br>
			Having used Bezier curves to create designs on applications like Adobe and Figma, it was fascinating to see how the curves were actually generated. Triangle meshes are also essential to computer graphics and defining visualizations, which made it so rewarding to develop and observe the creation of various shapes through the meshes.
			<br><br>

			<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

			<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
			De Casteljau’s algorithm is a recursive method used to evaluate Bézier curves. Given a set of control points, the algorithm linearly interpolates between them to compute intermediate points. After each step, the algorithm gradually refines the curve until a single point remains. This point lies on the Bézier curve for a given parameter t.
			<br>
			<br>
			To implement this algorithm, we created a recursive function by using the function <code>lerp(p_i, p_i+1, t) = (1-t)p_i + t*p_i+1</code> to perform one recursive step in <code>evaluateStep</code> that finds the intermediate control point between p_i and p_i+1 weighted by the float t.

			<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
			De Casteljau’s algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by evaluating the algorithm twice in two directions. For a grid of control points and a pair of parameters (u, v), we first evaluate point u on each row of control points with the de Casteljau’s algorithm. This gives us a set of intermediate points. Then, we evaluate point v on the “moving” curve with the intermediate points in the other direction. This results in a single point on the Bezier surface.
			<br><br>
			To implement this, we updated <code>evaluateStep</code> to take in a 3D vector and created a recursive function <code>evaluate1D</code> to run evaluateStep to obtain the final point. Next, we used this function to gain a vector of final points evaluated by each row, and finally ran <code>evaluate1D()</code> on this vector to evaluate by column, determining the surface of a nxn grid.

			<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

			<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
			To implement area-weighted vertex normals, we iterated through all the faces incident to a vertex using the half-edge data structure. After getting the vertices for each face by using a series of calls to <code>twin()</code>, <code>vertex()</code>, and <code>next()</code>, we computed the normal by taking the cross product of two edge vectors. The magnitude of this cross product was used to determine the triangle’s area, which was then used as a weight for the normal. We then first normalize the face normal and then multiply by the area before adding this to a sum outside our while loop. This gets us our final area-weighted vertex normal. This method ensures smooth shading by approximating the surface curvature using weighted contributions from surrounding faces.

			<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
			To implement the edge flip operation, we first took note of any variables that would be changed due to the operation. This included vertices, faces, half-edges, and edges. We also took note of each half-edge’s twin. We then used <code>setNeighbors()</code> to reassign each half-edge a new vertex, twin, next, edge, and face according to the flip. We then reassigned the half-edges of each face and vertex to their new corresponding half-edge. We did not run into a very interesting debugging experience. Our first time running our code for this operation, there was an edge missing after the flip. Turns out we forgot to reassign the correct twin for an edge.

			<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
			To implement the edge split operation, we first created a new vertex m. Similarly to part 5, we took note of any variables that would be changed due to the split: vertices, edges, half-edges, twins, and faces. We then set the position of the new vertex to be the midpoint of the edge going from B to C (the edge passed in). We then created three new edges, half-edges, and twins to connect vertex m to vertex a, b, and d. We reuse the original half-edge and its respective twin to connect m to vertex c. We also create two new faces. We then use <code>setNeighbors()</code> to reassign new half-edges, twins, vertices, “next” edges, etc. When assigning next edges, we ensured that the half-edges were all moving in a counterclockwise direction.

			<br>
			<br>
			There were a lot of variables to keep track of, and it quickly became very confusing at times. When implementing upsampling, we had to come back and retrace our steps several times to catch small errors in our code.

			<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
			We followed the recommended steps given to us in the spec to implement loop subdivision.
			<br><br>
			<b>Step 1:</b> We looped through all the vertices using the for loop given to us in the primer, and iterated through the half edges until we return to the original half edge to get the updated position of an old vertex. To determine the updated position, we used the formula <code>(1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum</code>.
			<br><br>
			<b>Step 2:</b> We iterated through all of the edges, finding the position of all 4 vertices and finding the new position using the formula <code>3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)</code>.
			<br><br>
			<b>Step 3:</b> We ran into a lot of infinite looping for this step. To resolve this, we created another vector to store all the original edges before splitting, and iterated through that vector to avoid difficulties with determining which edge was original when modifying edges with split edge. Going through the list of original edges, we called splitEdge() on the edge and updated the position and isNew flag.
			<br><br>
			<b>Step 4:</b> We iterated through all the edges, checked if it was new and whether only 1 of the vertices was new. If so, we called flipEdge().
			<br><br>
			<b>Step 5:</b> Finally, we updated the position using newPosition.

			Sharp corners and edges flatten out more than the flat surfaces, causing the shape to become increasingly asymmetric. We noticed that a lot of the asymmetry formed where the cube’s sides would form a harsh spike that over several upsampling iterations would result in an asymmetric cube. To resolve this, we split the half edge on every single face to ensure that when the mesh splits in upsampling, it would do so evenly across each face.
